## Research a Vunlerable Service
My group decided that we all wanted to use a Linux based vulnerability so we could all help trouble shoot and get our exploits set up. The service I chose was Think PHP, a Chinese PHP framework that uses Apache2. This service aims to simplify enterprise application development with MVC structure. Think PHP is currently at version 8.1. Think PHP has a big open source github directory that everyone can see and add to. I also chose this service because it is open source, allowing me to download it easily and prepare to exploit it. The tough thing about Think PHP is that it is a Chinese product, meaning all of the diagrams and information I found are in Chinese and I do not know Chinese.
