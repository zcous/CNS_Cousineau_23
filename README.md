CNS Fall 2023

# ABOUT
  This respository is for my Fall 2023 Computer and Netowrk Security class at USCGA.

# EDITOR
  The editor I chose to use for this class is Visual Studio Code because it is easy to use, is compatable with the OS we are using, and plugin capability. 

# BINARY INFORMATION
  The Binary file for the Vagrant host is done through downloading the AMD64 version 2.3.7 package from Hashicorp. The binary file is located in \HashiCorp\bin\vagrant.exe. To ensure the binary was in the correct place, I copied the binary to a location in your executable path by coping the binary to the location in my executable path. Vagrant allowed me to download the binary as a whole, and I then placed that binary in the correct loaction for this lab.
